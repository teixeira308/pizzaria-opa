# Supermarket Play: A Simple Web System for Kids

This project was created as a playful way for my fianc√©e's nephew to experience the basics of a web system. It's a simple HTML page simulating a supermarket system, where kids can play and learn how to interact with a basic interface. The project also serves as an introduction to web technologies and software engineering concepts.

## Motivation

The goal was to combine fun and learning, helping to spark interest in technology while working hands-on with a real-world scenario. As a developer, I believe in making technology accessible and fun, especially for younger generations.
