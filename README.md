# Supermarket Play: A Simple Web System for Kids

This project was created as a playful way for my fianc√©e's nephew to experience the basics of a web system. It's a simple HTML page simulating a supermarket system, where kids can play and learn how to interact with a basic interface. The project also serves as an introduction to web technologies and software engineering concepts.

## System flow

1. Selecting the product menu, the workflow starts on the register of new products, putting name and price. After saving the data, the modal don't close, waiting for a new product input.
2. After adding new products, the selling workflow starts selecting the products in a list and it's quantity. All the information about prices and total amount is refreshed and pressing the pay order button, the app generate a random value payed, generating a challenge for the user to calculate the change, only closing the order after providing the correct change.

## Motivation

The goal was to combine fun and learning, helping to spark interest in technology while working hands-on with a real-world scenario. As a developer, I believe in making technology accessible and fun, especially for younger generations.
